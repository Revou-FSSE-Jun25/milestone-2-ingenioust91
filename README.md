# Revofun - The Game Developer
**Revofun** is a casual web-based game collection created for employees who need a quick break from work stress. Each game is designed with storylines inspired by common workplace situations, making them both fun and relatable during office hours.

## Game Collection
**1. Anjing Meeting**
- **Theme:** Office meetings that never seem to end.  
- **Storyline:** You’re in a meeting where teammates keep throwing questions and counterarguments. Just like in real meetings, your answer might not be the final word—others will push back.  
- **Gameplay:** Based on *Rock-Paper-Scissors*.  
  1. The computer asks a random “meeting-style” question.  
  2. You choose one of three possible answers (representing rock, paper, or scissors).  
  3. The computer randomly counters with its own response (representing rock, paper, or scissors). 
  4. Winner is decided by rock-paper-scissors rules.

- **Theme:** Dealing with the boss whose desire can't be figured out.  
- **Storyline:** Your boss never gives a straight answer, and you must keep guessing until you figure out what they want.  
- **Gameplay:** Based on a *Number Guessing Game*.  
  1. The computer secretly picks a number between **1–100**.  
  2. You guess the number.  
  3. Each attempt is followed by a hint: **higher**, **lower**, or **correct**.  
  4. Find the boss’s number as fast as you can!
